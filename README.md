# FullStackApplication-Portfolio-V1

### This is my first full-stack application project completely planned, designed and developed by me individually.
### This application will serve as a personal portfolio as well as a learning platform for me to expand my knowledge and professional capacity.
### I will be showcasing my ability to build a fully functional and secure web application. I will be analyzing any mistakes I make or complications that arise, 
### troubleshoot those mistakes, 
### and resolve those issues using standardized practices and methods commonly used in the field of professional web development.
### I intend to further educate myself about the architectures, develop basic and advanced design skills, learn to implement protective measures 
### against possible cybersecurity threats as well as how to mitigate security breaches. Overall, I aim to create an architecturally sound web 
### application to strengthen my professional experience and to display my current skillset as a full-stack software developer.
